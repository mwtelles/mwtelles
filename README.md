# Hi there! 👋 I'm Telles

I'm a Software Architect and Front-End Lead with over a decade of experience in the industry.  
I specialize in creating **high-performance, scalable applications** with a strong focus on **user experience and design**.  

While my main expertise lies in **JavaScript, React, React Native, and Node.js**, I'm **not tied to any single language or framework** — I’m problem-oriented and adapt to the right technology for each challenge.
